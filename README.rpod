README for Tie::File::Indexed - fast tied array access to indexed data files

=cut

##======================================================================

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Tie::File::Indexed class provides fast tied array access to raw data-files
using an auxilliary packed index-file to store and retrieve the offsets and
lengths of the corresponding raw data strings as well as an additional header-file
to store administrative data, resulting in a constant and very small memory footprint.
Random-access storage and retrieval should both be very fast, and even
pop(), shift() and splice() operations on large arrays should be tolerably efficient,
since these only need to modify the (comparatively small) index-file.

The Tie::File::Indexed distribution also comes with several pre-defined
subclasses for transparent encoding/decoding of UTF8-encoded strings,
and complex data structures encoded via the L<JSON|JSON> or L<Storable|Storable>
modules.
